# Introduction to Data Visualization and Data Wrangling for R Users Group (Winter 2017)

## Course Objectives

The goal of the course is to get students familiar with the process of reading, manipulating, and visualizing data. The course will be taught primarily in R, but will touch on related topics such as R markdown, the "grammar of graphics", Shiny, and Git. 

Github Repo for the course: https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/Intro-Data-Viz-Winter-2017

## Code of Conduct

All participants will be expected to follow the SIO Open Data Science Code of Conduct: https://open-data-science-at-sio.github.io/mission.html

Note that this applies both to the physical space for classes, as well as online interactions in the chatroom, mailing list, and Github repository.

## Target Audience

Students should have some familiarity with programming and/or R (e.g. past experience programming in R for an introductory stats course). A short introductory course in R (e.g. https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) will also suffice.

### Pre-requisites

Students who plan to attend should install R (https://cran.r-project.org/), RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), and Git (https://git-scm.com/). While RStudio is not strictly necessary for this course, it will ensure a standard user interface for students to follow along.

Students should also create a GitHub account (https://github.com/).

## Logistics

Class meets every Thursday 1pm - 2:30pm in Hubbs Hall 4500 (unless otherwise noted).

Each class will be ~~30-45~~ 60 min. of guided code demos, followed by ~~30-45~~ 30 min of Q&A / interactive lab sessions.

Students are **highly encouraged** to bring laptops to class to follow along.
