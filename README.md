Intro-level data visualization and data wrangling for R Users Group (Winter quarter 2017)

The primary goal of the course is to get students familiar with the process of reading, manipulating, and visualizing data. The course will be taught primarily in R, but will touch on related topics such as R markdown, the "grammar of graphics", Shiny, and Git. 

Github Repo for the course: https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/Intro-Data-Viz-Winter-2017

## Target Audience

Students should have some familiarity with programming and/or R (e.g. past experience programming in R for an introductory stats course). A short introductory course in R (e.g. https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) will also suffice.

## Pre-requisites

Students who plan to attend should install R (https://cran.r-project.org/), RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), and Git (https://git-scm.com/). While RStudio is not strictly necessary for this course, it will ensure a standard user interface for students to follow along.

Students should also create a GitHub account (https://github.com/).

## Logistics

Class meets every Thursday 1pm - 2:30pm in Hubbs Hall 4500 (unless otherwise noted).

Each class will be 30-45 min. of guided code demos, followed by 30-45 min of Q&A / interactive lab sessions.

Students are **highly encouraged** to bring laptops to class to follow along.
