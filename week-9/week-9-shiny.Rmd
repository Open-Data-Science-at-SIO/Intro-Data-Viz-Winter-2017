# First, a not-so-shiny story

I came to SIO in Dec 2012 with the task of writing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to run stable isotope mixing models. I ended up using an R package called `gwidgetsRGtk2`, which did the job:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(MixSIAR)
mixsiar_gui()
```

## Why didn't I use Shiny?

* It was new and not well documented in 2013. This has HUGELY changed!
* Didn't appreciate the momentum behind R Studio
* The "server" talk made me think it *had* to be hosted online (not true, can be [deployed locally](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/deployment-local.html))
* Seemed designed for lightweight computing, not long model runs

I am still not sure if it would have been more or less straightforward to use `Shiny` instead of `gWidgetsRGtk2`... but if I were starting from scratch I would use Shiny. Mostly based on the user community and documentation/examples available now.

## It's got "widgets"

## When would I use a Shiny GUI/app?

* Expand reach of your research by reducing barriers to others using your
    * methods (ex: MixSIAR)
    * data (ex: [AFSC Seal surveys](https://jmlondon.shinyapps.io/akpvsurveys-app/))

* Teaching courses (ex: [regression](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/slr_diag/))

* Data exploration

* Data analysis (ex: classify plankton)

# 2. "Get started" (tutorial)

Because I have never used Shiny, let's let R Studio explain the basics:
